    <p>Note that if the "fast-diff" feature is not enabled on images, openATTIC won't display the "used" size, as this operation will require querying the OSDs for every potential object within the image, which is a time-consuming and I/O-intensive operation. However, images with this feature enabled can't be mapped by the Ceph kernel client "kRBD".</p>

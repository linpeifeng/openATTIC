    <p>RBD images are striped over many objects, which are then stored by the Ceph distributed object store (RADOS).</p>
    <p>Striping features:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Read and write requests distributed across many nodes</li>
        <li>Prevents single node bottleneck for large or busy RBDs</li>
    </ul>

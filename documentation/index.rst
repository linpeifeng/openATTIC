|oA| |version| Documentation
############################

|oA| is an Open Source Ceph and storage management solution for Linux, with a
strong focus on storage management in a datacenter environment.

The various resources of a Ceph cluster can be managed and monitored from a
central web-based management interface. It is no longer necessary to be
intimately familiar with the inner workings of the individual Ceph components.
Any task can be carried out by either using |oA|'s intuitive web interface or
via the REST API.

Introduction to the |oA| Graphical User Interface
=================================================

The |oA| web interface is based on the `AngularJS
<https://angularjs.org/>`_ JavaScript framework combined with the `Bootstrap
<https://getbootstrap.com>`_ HTML/CSS framework, to provide a modern look and
feel.

This manual describes how to use the |oA| web user interface (GUI) for
performing storage management tasks like creating Ceph pools and RBD images,
configuring iSCSI targets, NFS shares, as well as system management tasks like
the configuration of users and API credentials, and the integrated monitoring
system.
